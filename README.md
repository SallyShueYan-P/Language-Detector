# Language-Detector
Developed a Python algorithm for accurate language detection in arbitrary texts. Leveraged a comprehensive dataset of 21 languages from the European Union Proceedings and incorporated valuable insights from a research article. The primary objective of this project was to create a high-performing Python algorithm capable of precisely identifying the language of diverse texts, ranging from sentences to lengthy passages. By utilizing this algorithm, users can expect reliable language classifications, such as "en" for English or "fr" for French. This project represents a significant advancement in language detection techniques, contributing to enhanced language analysis and applications.
